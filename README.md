# MICRO-ML
I am on a journey to explore and Implement the machine Learning Algotrithms on Arduino.
I always wanted to learn arduino and other micro controllers. 
My project on arduino was Master-Slave.
I need used tachometer to control the rpm of motors that i used in my scale down model SU-47. 
Although that was a Failure but i kept trying.
My Second Project is DIGIT Rcognizer I learnt a lot to make this. Developing is dificult than understanding a Code.
