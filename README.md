# MICRO-ML
I am on a journey to explore and Implement the machine Learning Algotrithms on Arduino.
I always wanted to learn arduino and other micro controllers. 
My First project on arduino was Master-Slave. I used tachometer to control the rpm of motors to reduce the torque in my scale down model of SU-47. 
Although that was a Failure. But Covid 19 Lockdown gave me time to implement machine learning algorithms on arduino.
To Implement Codes on Arduino or any Micro Controller you have to take care of Memory. My Second Project Digit recognizer is only 7KB, Still I am trying to optimize my code to make it more efficient.
